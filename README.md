# David's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built with React. It contains a small intro, a list of technologies I use and some projects.

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
